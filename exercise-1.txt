Exercise 1 - Pseudocode Challenge

==================================================

No 1. Newton Second Law
-------------------------
Algoritm:
1. Store value of 'mass' in 'variable'
2. Store value of 'acceleration' in 'variable'
3. Calculate the equation using Newton Second Law (F = m * a)
4. Store the calculation value in 'variable' 'force'
5. Display the 'force' value

Pseudocode:
SET 'mass' to 600
SET 'acceleration' to 2
CALCULATE 'force' as multiplication of 'mass' and 'acceleration'
STORE the calculation in 'variable' 'force'
DISPLAY 'force' value

No 2. Leap Year
-------------------------
Algoritm:
1. Store 'year' as a 'variable' with a value
2. Enter the year into leap year function
3. Check if 'year' is a leap year
4. If 'year' modulus 4 is zero and 'year' modulus 100 is not zero, 'year' is a leap year
5. If 'year' modulus 4, 100, 400 is zero, 'year is a leap year

Pseudocode:
SET 'year' with a value
IF 'year' modulus 4 is zero and 'year' modulus 100 is not zero THEN
    SHOW 'year is a leap year'
ELSEIF 'year' modulus 4 is zero and 'year' modulus 100 is zero and 'year' modulus 400 is zero THEN
    SHOW 'year is a leap year'
ELSE
    SHOW 'year is not a leap year'
ENDIF

No 3. Laundry Day
-------------------------
Algoritm:
1. Set 'basket' as a 'variable' with initial value of 20
2. Set 'clothes' as a 'variable' with initial value of 0
3. Set 'washMachine' as a 'variable' with initial value of false
4. Add clothes to washMachine and reduce the value in the basket
5. If clothes is already 20 and basket is 0, set washMachine as on (true)
6. Else washMachine is off (false)

Pseudocode:
SET 'basket' as a 'variable' with initial value of 20
SET 'clothes' as a 'variable' with initial value of 0
SET 'washMachine' as a 'variable' with initial value of false
WHILE 'basket' is not zero
    INCREMENT 'clothes' by 1
    DECREMENT 'basket' by 1
    IF 'clothes' equal to 20 and 'basket' equal to 0 THEN
        SET 'washMachine' as true
    ELSE
        SET 'washMachine' as false
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE

No 4. Check Nails
-------------------------
Algoritm:
1. Set 'numberOfStudents' as a 'variable' with a value of 40
2. Run loops of inspection until counter reach the same value as numberOfStudents
3. If during inspection, teacher finds student with 'long nails', then display 'punish the student'
4. If during inspection, teacher finds student with 'short nails', then display 'praise the student'

Pseudocode:
SET 'numberOfStudents' to 40
SET 'counter' to 0
WHILE 'counter' is not equal to numberOfStudents
    IF 'student' has 'long nails' THEN
        DISPLAY 'punish the student'
    ELSEIF 'student' has 'short nails' THEN
        DISPLAY 'praise the student'
    ENDIF
    INCREMENT 'counter' by 1
ENDWHILE
